# Dump_Truck_Discrete_Event_Simulation
An implementation of a dumptruck-payload system where a group of dumptrucks undergo a series of operations and the entire process is monitored and outputted. 

The operations in question incude loading, weighing, and travelling. The time for each operation is pseudo-randomly generated using predefined cumulative probability distributions. The output file consists of a list of events that shows the future-event-list and shows a queue of waiting dumptrucks that are to be serviced. The output also shows various other properties as well as the proportion of customers with 30 minutes+ response time.
